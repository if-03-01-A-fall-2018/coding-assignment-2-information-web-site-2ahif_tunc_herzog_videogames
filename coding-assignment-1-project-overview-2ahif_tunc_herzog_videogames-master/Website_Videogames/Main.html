			<h2> What Are Videogames? </h2>
			<p> A computer (or video) game is a computer-controlled game where players interact with objects displayed on a screen for the sake of
			entertainment.
            The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their
			primary feedback device, or a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above.  </p>
